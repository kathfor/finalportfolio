        I am a current student at the University of Michigan majoring in User Experience. Transforming experiences creatively and strategically has always been my passion.
        <br></br>
        Innovative thinker and communicator who is able to tackle new technology to create experiences that change how people interact digitally. Looking to expand my understanding of what makes high-impact products work. Currently searching for an internship in UI/UX design, product design, or customer experience. <br></br>

        During my past projects, I have focused heavily on developing an effective process in order to transform digital experiences. Through this method, I consider not only the user experience, but also the customer experience. I also continue to learn how to balance user needs + business goals + smart technology. This rough framework outlines my process: <br></br>

          <ol class = "uxsteps">
          <li> <b> Research: </b> Understand the variety of users that will be interacting with the platform, while catering to as many personas as possible. This also includes getting to know the intended experience from the client's perspective. Then, I use this data to drive future designs. </li>
          <li> <b>Ideas:</b> Spend time brainstorming with the team and potential users to come up with creative ways to solve the given problem using technology. End-to-end experience thinking is important here.</li>
          <li><b>Structure: </b>Working with cross functional teams to determine deliverables and deadlines. </li>
          <li>Create, evaluate, and iterate: </li>
          </ol>

            <ul class = "bullets">
              <li> Wireframes </li>
              <li> Use cases and scenarios </li>
              <li> User flows </li>
              <li> Sketches, logos, and infographics </li>
              <li> Key brand identity features </li>
            </ul><br></br>

      <p> Communication is the key to this process, and is present in every step. Daring to think big is even more important.</p>
